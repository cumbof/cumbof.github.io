## Research Interests

My research interests include but are not limited to:

- __Bioinformatics__: with a research experience of over 10 years, my interests cover a wide spectrum of research areas under the bioinformatics domain with a particular emphasis on Metagenomics and the design of new computational techniques for the characterization of microbial species.

- __Machine Learning__: experienced in teaching modern Big Data Analytics and Visualization techniques, I also designed novel energy- and memory-efficient machine learning methods for dealing with massive amounts of biomedical data with commodity hardware as well as in distributed environments.

- __Hyperdimensional Computing__: a.k.a. Vector-Symbolic Architectures, this is an emerging way of computing with vectors in a high-dimensional space. As a new computational paradigm, it has an innumerable fields of application, including artificial intelligence, cognitive science, robotics, natural language processing, bioinformatics, and the internet of things, among other scientific disciplines.
